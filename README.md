# ProjectÂ´
Project to improve the performance of the code for a multimedia search and retrieval system

# Motivation
At the beginning of my Master studies we struggled with handling the large data size necessary for this project. The code needed far more than 12h to complete. Now, I want to challenge myself to improve the code and learn how to write code that is perfomant.

# Project overview
1. Identify bottlenecks by profiling the code
2. Improve algorithmic performance
3. Improve data infrastructrure
4. Compare results and identify best practices
